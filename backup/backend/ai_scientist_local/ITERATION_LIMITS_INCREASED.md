# AI Scientist Iteration Limits Increased

## 🔄 Issue Addressed

The previous HTAP experiment failed after reaching the maximum iteration limit of 20 steps without finding a working implementation. All 20 nodes were marked as buggy due to missing dependencies (psycopg2) and lack of proper Docker environment setup.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Configuration File Updated: `bfts_config.yaml`**

#### **Before (Insufficient for Real System Building):**
```yaml
stages:
  stage1_max_iters: 20  # ❌ Insufficient for Docker + PostgreSQL setup
  stage2_max_iters: 12  # ❌ Too few for baseline tuning
  stage3_max_iters: 12  # ❌ Too few for creative research
  stage4_max_iters: 18  # ❌ Too few for ablation studies
steps: 5                # ❌ Very low default fallback
```

#### **After (Sufficient for Docker + Real Systems):**
```yaml
stages:
  stage1_max_iters: 50  # ✅ Sufficient for Docker setup + PostgreSQL compilation + real experiments
  stage2_max_iters: 30  # ✅ Adequate for baseline tuning with real data
  stage3_max_iters: 30  # ✅ Adequate for creative research with real systems
  stage4_max_iters: 25  # ✅ Adequate for ablation studies
steps: 15               # ✅ Higher default fallback for complex experiments
```

## 🎯 Rationale for Increased Limits

### **Stage 1 (50 iterations) - Initial Implementation:**
**Complex tasks requiring more iterations:**
1. **Docker Environment Setup** (5-8 iterations)
   - Create Dockerfile with all dependencies
   - Build Docker image
   - Test container functionality
   - Debug any build issues

2. **PostgreSQL Source Compilation** (10-15 iterations)
   - Git clone PostgreSQL source
   - Configure build environment
   - Compile PostgreSQL from source
   - Initialize database
   - Debug compilation issues

3. **TPC-H Data Setup** (8-12 iterations)
   - Download and build TPC-H tools
   - Generate benchmark data
   - Create database schemas
   - Load data into PostgreSQL
   - Verify data integrity

4. **Basic Experiment Implementation** (15-20 iterations)
   - Implement query feature extraction
   - Set up basic routing functionality
   - Test query execution
   - Debug initial implementation
   - Achieve working baseline

### **Stage 2 (30 iterations) - Baseline Tuning:**
- Fine-tune model parameters with real data
- Optimize query feature extraction
- Improve routing accuracy
- Debug performance issues

### **Stage 3 (30 iterations) - Creative Research:**
- Implement advanced features
- Test novel routing strategies
- Conduct comprehensive experiments
- Debug complex interactions

### **Stage 4 (25 iterations) - Ablation Studies:**
- Systematic component analysis
- Feature importance studies
- Performance degradation tests
- Final optimization

## 📊 Expected Impact

### **Previous Failure Pattern:**
```
Iteration 1-20: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
Result: All nodes marked as buggy, experiment terminated
```

### **Expected Success Pattern:**
```
Iterations 1-8:    Docker environment setup and dependency installation
Iterations 9-20:   PostgreSQL source compilation and database setup
Iterations 21-35:  TPC-H data generation and loading
Iterations 36-50:  Basic routing implementation and testing
Result: Working implementation achieved, proceed to next stages
```

## 🚀 Integration Status

- ✅ **Configuration updated** in `bfts_config.yaml`
- ✅ **Automatic application** via `launch_scientist_bfts.py`
- ✅ **No code changes required** - purely configuration-driven
- ✅ **Compatible with Docker enhancements** from previous updates

## 🔧 Validation

To verify the new limits are applied:
```bash
# The start script will automatically use the updated config
bash start_htap_research.sh

# Monitor progress - should now show higher iteration limits
# Stage 1: Step X/50 instead of Step X/20
```

## ⚡ Expected Results

With increased iteration limits and Docker environment setup:

1. **Stage 1 Success**: Working PostgreSQL compilation and TPC-H data loading
2. **No Dependency Failures**: All required packages pre-installed in Docker
3. **Real System Building**: Actual source code modifications and compilation
4. **Complete Experiments**: Full HTAP routing implementation and evaluation

The system now has sufficient iterations to complete complex real-system experiments while maintaining scientific integrity through the enhanced anti-fraud requirements.
