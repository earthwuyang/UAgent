# OpenHands Headless CLI Solution - Final Implementation

## Problem Solved

Successfully implemented OpenHands in **headless CLI mode** within a single Docker container, avoiding Docker-in-Docker complexity while maintaining hardware isolation for scientific experiments.

## Key Architectural Decision

### ✅ **Headless CLI Mode (Current Implementation):**
- Single Docker container running OpenHands CLI
- Uses `eventstream` runtime (no nested Docker containers)
- Proper hardware isolation from host system
- Simple and reliable execution

### ❌ **Docker-in-Docker (Previous Attempt):**
- OpenHands trying to spawn more Docker containers inside container
- Complex permission management required
- Unnecessary complexity for scientific experiments

## Final Configuration

### 1. Runtime Configuration
```python
env = {
    "RUNTIME": "eventstream",  # Headless CLI mode
    "WORKSPACE_BASE": "/workspace",
    "HOME": "/tmp/openhands_home",

    # Playwright browsers for web interactions
    "PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH": "/tmp/openhands_home/.cache/ms-playwright",
    "PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "false",
}
```

### 2. Container Setup
```python
cmd = [
    "bash", "-c", f"""
    # Install Playwright browsers if needed
    /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps || true

    # Run OpenHands in headless CLI mode
    /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python -m openhands.core.main \\
        -t '{enhanced_goal}' \\
        -n {cfg.session_name} \\
        --max-iterations {cfg.max_steps} \\
        --no-auto-continue
    """
]
```

### 3. Volume Mounts (No Docker Socket Needed)
```python
volumes = {
    str(cfg.workspace.resolve()): {"bind": "/workspace", "mode": "rw"},
    f"{openhands_temp}/logs": {"bind": "/openhands/code/logs", "mode": "rw"},
    f"{openhands_temp}/cache": {"bind": "/openhands/code/cache", "mode": "rw"},
    f"{openhands_temp}/tmp": {"bind": "/tmp/openhands", "mode": "rw"},
    f"{openhands_temp}/home": {"bind": "/tmp/openhands_home", "mode": "rw"},
}
```

## Benefits for Scientific Research

### ✅ **Hardware Isolation Achieved:**
- OpenHands runs in isolated Docker container
- Host system protected from crashes during experiments
- PG + DuckDB experiments safely contained

### ✅ **Simplified Architecture:**
- No Docker-in-Docker complexity
- No Docker socket permission issues
- Reliable eventstream runtime

### ✅ **Complete Monitoring:**
- Real-time log streaming to `/workspace/logs/openhands_live/`
- Container execution monitoring
- Full experiment transparency

### ✅ **Dependency Management:**
- Automatic Playwright browser installation
- Proper Poetry environment isolation
- All necessary permissions configured

## Technical Details

### Container Image
- `docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.57-nikolaik`
- Poetry environment: `/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python`
- Full OpenHands CLI capabilities

### Execution Flow
1. Container starts with proper user permissions
2. Playwright browsers installed automatically
3. OpenHands CLI runs in eventstream mode
4. All output streamed to live monitoring logs
5. Results saved to `experiments/{session}/results/final.json`
6. Container cleanup with temp directory removal

### File Structure
```
workspace/
├── experiments/
│   └── {session_name}/
│       └── results/
│           └── final.json
├── logs/
│   └── openhands_live/
│       ├── live_combined.log
│       ├── live_stdout.log
│       ├── live_stderr.log
│       └── container_status.json
└── README_UAGENT.md
```

## Result

The OpenHands integration now provides:

- ✅ **True hardware isolation** through containerization
- ✅ **Headless CLI execution** without Docker-in-Docker complexity
- ✅ **Complete monitoring** of all experiment activity
- ✅ **Reliable operation** for scientific research workflows
- ✅ **Proper dependency management** including Playwright browsers
- ✅ **Secure permissions** without compromising functionality

This solution is perfect for scientific experiments requiring:
- Database operations (PostgreSQL + DuckDB)
- Web scraping and analysis
- Code generation and execution
- Complex multi-step research workflows

All while maintaining complete isolation from the host system to prevent crashes and ensure reproducible results.
