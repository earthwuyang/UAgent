## Key Features Verified

### 🌳 Tree Visualization Features
- **ReactFlow Integration**: Advanced node-based tree visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live progress tracking
- **Interactive Nodes**: Clickable nodes with detailed information
- **Status Indicators**: Visual representation of research progress
- **Hierarchical Display**: Parent-child relationships in research processes

### 🔄 Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `ws://localhost:8012/ws/research/{session_id}`
- **Progress Streaming**: Live updates as research progresses
- **Event Processing**: Handles research engine events
- **Auto-reconnection**: Maintains connection stability

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Tree view integrated in research dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Status Animations**: Visual feedback for active processes
- **Detailed Sidebar**: Additional information panel for selected nodes

## Research Engines Integration

The tree view properly displays all three research engines:

1. **🔍 Deep Research Engine** - General research tasks
2. **💻 Code Research Engine** - Code analysis and development
3. **🧪 Scientific Research Engine** - Academic and scientific research

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Component Analysis
```bash
python test_tree_view_components.py
```
- Analyzed all React components for tree view functionality
- Verified ReactFlow integration and WebSocket support
- Confirmed proper component hierarchy and integration

### 2. Backend API Testing
- Tested all research-related endpoints
- Created test research sessions
- Verified API response formats and data structures

### 3. Dependency Verification
- Checked package.json for required dependencies
- Verified all necessary packages are installed
- Confirmed version compatibility

## How to Use Tree View

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 12000`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Open Browser**: Navigate to the frontend URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`)
4. **Create Research**: Use the research input form to start a new research task
5. **View Tree**: Click on the "🌳 Tree View" tab in the research dashboard
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates as research engines process the task

### Expected Behavior:
- Tree nodes appear representing different research engines
- Nodes change color/status as research progresses
- WebSocket connection provides real-time updates
- Clicking nodes shows detailed information in sidebar
- Progress indicators show completion status

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **ReactFlow** for tree visualization
- **Vite** for development and building
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication

### Backend Stack:
- **FastAPI** for REST API
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **Research Engines** for processing
- **Session Management** for tracking research tasks
